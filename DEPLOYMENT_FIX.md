# ✅ SPA Routing Fix for Deployment

## Problem
Getting 404 errors when refreshing pages or directly visiting URLs like:
- `/career/zookal`
- `/blog/some-post`
- `/projects/some-project`

## Why This Happens
Your app is a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using React Router:
- All routes are handled by JavaScript in the browser
- When you refresh, the server tries to find `/career/zookal` file
- File doesn't exist → 404 error

## Solution Applied

### For Vercel
Created `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

This tells Vercel: **redirect all routes to index.html**, then React Router handles the routing.

### For Netlify (Backup)
Created `public/_redirects`:
```
/* /index.html 200
```

This does the same thing for Netlify deployments.

## How to Deploy

### Redeploy to Vercel
```bash
# Build with new config
bun run build

# Deploy
bunx vercel --prod
```

The `vercel.json` will be automatically picked up by Vercel.

### Or Deploy Fresh
```bash
bunx vercel
# Follow prompts
```

## What This Fixes

**Before:**
- ✅ Home page works (/)
- ✅ Clicking links works
- ❌ Refresh on route → 404
- ❌ Direct URL → 404

**After:**
- ✅ Home page works (/)
- ✅ Clicking links works
- ✅ Refresh on route → Works!
- ✅ Direct URL → Works!
- ✅ Browser back/forward → Works!

## Testing

After deploying, test these URLs directly:
1. `https://your-domain.vercel.app/`
2. `https://your-domain.vercel.app/blog`
3. `https://your-domain.vercel.app/career/zookal`
4. `https://your-domain.vercel.app/projects/some-project`

All should work now! ✅

## Files Created

- ✅ `vercel.json` - Vercel SPA routing config
- ✅ `public/_redirects` - Netlify SPA routing config (backup)

## Next Steps

1. Run: `bun run build`
2. Deploy: `bunx vercel --prod`
3. Test all routes by refreshing
4. ✅ Should work!

## Note

This is a **standard SPA configuration** required for all client-side routed apps on static hosting platforms.
