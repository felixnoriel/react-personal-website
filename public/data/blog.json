    "content": "<h1>5 Things to do in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam</h1>\n<p>Ho Chi Minh is the capital city of Vietnam, there are a lot of things you can do here but you can squeeze your time and do amazing things in just few days!</p>\n<p>Travelling to Vietnam was a big challenge for me since this was the very first time I travelled solo. I was excited when I got my plans sorted out already beforehand, but then again I was having doubts to proceed with the tour for the reason of being scared on what may happen to me being alone. On the night before my flight, I was on the verge of backing out completely because I was afraid of doing something for the first time. But I know deep inside myself that I need to do this. So the day came and the next thing I knew I was on my way to Vietnam for my first solo travel.</p>\n<p>Spending just few days in Saigon, I experienced a lot of things and was very glad I did it. This was definitely one thing that made me came out of my comfort zone, and a first from crazy experience to more!</p>\n<h2>Here are things you can do if you only have few days</h2>\n<h3>1. Eat local food</h3>\n<p>One of the best thing in Vietnam is you can find good food anywhere you go! I was really looking forward for the food here and it was one of the main reason why I want to come here. Local food is the best! It&#8217;s tasty and cheap!</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1910\" style=\"width: 655px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1910\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/12/IMG_9336.jpg\" alt=\"img_9336\" width=\"655\" height=\"491\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Noodles with beef and grilled local fish</figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1926\" style=\"width: 653px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1926\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/12/IMG_9561.jpg\" alt=\"img_9561\" width=\"653\" height=\"490\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pho in the streets of Saigon</figcaption></figure>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1928\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/12/IMG_9568.jpg\" alt=\"img_9568\" width=\"647\" height=\"486\" /></p>\n<p>Eat a lot of Pho. This is actually the best Pho I had because nothing beats the local! I was a bit lost somewhere in Saigon where I can&#8217;t find any restaurant with English menu. As I was walking wondering where to go, I saw this woman making broth of Pho literally in a corner of a street and a lot of people were eating in just small tables and chairs. I knew from that moment that the food is good–so I quickly went to her and ordered Pho, I was speaking to her in English but she can&#8217;t seem to understand me, good thing someone overheard us and translated my order to the lady. People here rock!</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1909\" style=\"width: 704px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1909\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/12/IMG_9319.jpg\" alt=\"img_9319\" width=\"704\" height=\"528\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pho from a local restaurant</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to try the vietnamese coffee! They use condensed milk instead of the natural milk, and their freshly brewed coffee is amazing! Make it an ice coffee for the hot weather!</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1925\" style=\"width: 704px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1925\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/12/IMG_9404.jpg\" alt=\"img_9404\" width=\"704\" height=\"528\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vietnamese coffee</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>2. Cu chi tunnel tour</h3>\n<p>This is one of the popular tours you can do in Saigon. During WWII, Vietnamese soldiers use this little hole as a hiding spot for enemies.</p>\n<p>You think you can fit into that?</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1913\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/12/IMG_9825.jpg\" alt=\"img_9825\" width=\"732\" height=\"549\" /></p>\n<p>Just look how small it is and how a person can fit into it! Crazy, I know. It&#8217;s interesting that you learn about these things happened in the past especially during the time of war, you&#8217;ll see how creative people become for setting traps and stuff. Kinda scary if you ask me and fascinating at the same time!<br />\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1912\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/12/IMG_9823.jpg\" alt=\"img_9823\" width=\"736\" height=\"552\" /></p>\n<h3>3. Mekong delta tour</h3>\n<p>This is another famous tour you can do here. I got a deal for this tour in the hostel I was staying at and they had a very good deal. Cheaper than the people offering outside the streets. I got the 2 days tour which includes an overnight home stay and I was looking forward to that to experience a night with the locals. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1914\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/12/IMG_9424.jpg\" alt=\"img_9424\" width=\"737\" height=\"553\" /></p>\n<p>Mekong river is one of the longest river in the world, you can get to different countries through this. The explanation to us why this river is color brown was because it carries too much silt, that brings additional nutrients and thus, fruits that grow within the area absorbs it and produces sweet taste!<br />\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1916\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/12/IMG_9444.jpg\" alt=\"img_9444\" width=\"717\" height=\"537\" /></p>\n<p>This lunch was included in the tour, except for that big fish which you can buy and I recommend that you do so if ever you&#8217;ll be doing it by tour (I think all tour has one main spot where they take the group for lunch). The food was alright, I was more excited with that fish which they catch it live from the river, fry them and serve it. So the best way to eat it is make it as a vietnamese roll and dip it in their amazing sauce! I got to talk to the people I&#8217;m in the table with, share some stories while we eat this fantastic lunch.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1915\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/12/IMG_9390.jpg\" alt=\"img_9390\" width=\"708\" height=\"531\" /></p>\n<p>Mekong delta tour homestay included &#8211; So after the whole day tour, the guide gave us instructions on how we are going to a local place for our homestay.</p>\n<p>The locals taught us how to do/cook some local food like frying spring rolls. After that we had our dinner, which was so amazing! The feeling was great! Sharing a plate with people who you just met and local people there, and all of just were just sharing stories and laughter. The next day, I get to go around the village by riding a bike since we have a time to spare.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1922\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/12/IMG_9408.jpg\" alt=\"img_9408\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></p>\n<h3>4. Visit the war museum</h3>\n<p>Check out some vietnamese history!<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1917\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/12/IMG_9300.jpg\" alt=\"img_9300\" width=\"713\" height=\"535\" /></p>\n<p>This museum represents how people fought for their country–why it even started, weapons they&#8217;ve used, or the tragedy they suffered. It&#8217;s depressing reading stories of people&#8217;s experiences during the war–how people was being treated, they have nothing to eat for days, or just the war itself.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1918\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/12/IMG_9312.jpg\" alt=\"img_9312\" width=\"710\" height=\"533\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>5. Night life</h3>\n<p>Ho Chi Minh is also famous for its night life! Especially on the busy streets where you can find a lot of foreigners drinking and partying. How can you go wrong with a cheap beer and the chance to socialise with people from all over the world? I tell you, prepare to have a crazy night!</p>\n<p>Just be careful, some nights can be crazy as hell and you don&#8217;t want yourself having troubles.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1919\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/12/IMG_9343.jpg\" alt=\"img_9343\" width=\"714\" height=\"536\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1920\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/12/IMG_9345.jpg\" alt=\"img_9345\" width=\"707\" height=\"530\" /></p>\n<p>Explore night markets, there are a lot of things happening here–from cheap stuffs to great food choices! Just make sure you have a big appetite coming beforehand because you&#8217;re definitely going to try a lot of street food!</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1927\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/12/IMG_9331.jpg\" alt=\"img_9331\" width=\"802\" height=\"601\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Bring it on!</p>\n<p>We went to the skydiving site, registered and gave us instructions. I&#8217;m on the last batch and have to wait for the first batches to finish first.</p>\n<p>I noticed there are two batches of skydiving instructors, they take turns every flight. So when it&#8217;s my turn, I guess my instructor was already tired. I just hope he doesn&#8217;t forget to pull out the parachute in time! Haha.</p>\n<h3>Waiting time&#8230;</h3>\n<p>the worst feeling I had. Just thinking whether you&#8217;ll still be alive after this or not.

It&#8217;s also packed with activities to do day and night! It&#8217;s like a 24/7 things to do! How are you going to enjoy these? Of course bring friends and do all crazy stuff! Me and my friends spent 4 days and 3 nights in this island. But I tell you, it wasn&#8217;t enough! I suggest to stay long and explore more of Phuket. Planning to go there? This itinerary might help you.</p>\n<h2>Day 1 &#8211; Check in at hostel, roam around Bangla road &amp; Patong beach</h2>\n<p>First stop! We rode a taxi from the airport to our hostel which was about 45 mins drive and about 800 Baht. We did not had a hard time trying to find the hostel since it was in a good location and has instructions on how to get there from the airport.</p>\n<p>We stayed in a Hostel, I prefer staying in a hostel when I travel to these kinds of places. Accommodation are way less cheaper than hotels. Location wise it&#8217;s good because it&#8217;s like 5mins walk away from the beach and the nightlife! Tours are cheaper compared to the agencies outside.</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/1.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/22.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p>If you want to check the hostel we stayed at, you can check it <a href=\"http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Patong-Backpacker-Hostel/Phuket-Patong-Beach/38579\">here</a>.<br />\n<strong>Price: </strong>34 USD/night = 3 beds in 1 room<br />\nYou can check the website for more details</p>\n<p>This what the reception at the hostel looks like. Staff are nice and approachable, we even asked them what kind of tours are suitable with our schedule since we arrived in late and we want some activities the next morning. They were very helpful for setting us up in a tour on the last minute. Our stay was very pleasant, indeed!</p>\n<p>We checked in when we arrived. I booked a room with three bed that will accommodate the 3 of us. It has its own bathroom inside but you can still use the shared bathroom outside in able for all of you to prepare at the same time.</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/32.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lounge area at the hostel</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Hostel has its own lounge for travelers to meet, chit-chat or relax. You can setup a movie in the lounge so you can watch movies during your free time, It has wifi of course, bean bags and foam mattress where you can lay down and relax. It&#8217;s also 5mins walk from the patong beach, night life. Eateries and massages everywhere.</p>\n<p>We left our things and went out right away since it was already late and we&#8217;re starving. We will roam around the night life first and find something to eat after.</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/2.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p>The famous patong beach! located in Bangla road. Phuket is also known for it&#8217;s nightlife. Among beaches in Phuket, Patong beach is the most popular one. People stay up and party all night! So if you&#8217;re into these kinds of stuff, just make sure that before you go, you get some sleep because you&#8217;re not getting one here!</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/20.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/21.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<h3>Bangla Road is where the bars, clubs and party freaks are.</h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s also lots of locals trying to invite you and watch girls dancing in the pole in the nightclubs. You can do it just for the experience if you are curious too. Just make sure they are real women. Haha. Just walk around here and you can see a lot of people drinking, partying and socializing. Mixed races from different parts of the world.</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/3.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p>After roaming around and have checked all the eateries around we end up eating in a hawker centre near our hostel and Bangla road.<br />\nThis is our first meal in Phuket. We had Tom yum soup, shrimp pad thai, vegetable rolls and down it with a local thai beer! We shared everything so we can try everything, except for the beer of course!</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/4.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p>After dinner, we roam around bangla road again to see how it goes. It was pretty late so I think people are already drunk and no where to be found. We went to the beach, had few drinks and shared some stories. We felt a bit hungry, went back to the road and looked for food. There&#8217;s a lot of streetfoods around. Regarding the food, even though we were already that hungry, we didn&#8217;t find the food good. It has a different taste and maybe we are just not used to it like the locals do. But it&#8217;s still worth a try for the experience.</p>\n<p>It was already around 4am when we finished. We went back to the hostel to get couple of hours sleep and be ready for the next day. Told you that you won&#8217;t be having any sleep here! Haha.</p>\n<h2>Day 2 &#8211; James Bond Island &#8211; <b>Khao Phing Kan in Phang Nga Bay</b></h2>\n<p>We woke up early because we need to book our tour since it was already very late when we arrived and was not possible to book any tour. Reception told us to come early and they can arrange things for us. We were supposed to do Phi Phi Island first but there were no available seats left for us. We asked the receptionist for recommendations and they said James Bond Island was a very good tour and has room that can accommodate us 3. We booked it and instructed us to come back after 45minutes because the tour guide will pick us up at the hostel. My friends grabbed a quick bite, I just had water since I&#8217;m not a breakfast person. Anyway, there will be snacks &amp; coffee at the waiting area of the tour before heading to the Island itself.</p>\n<p>We went back to the hostel and waited for the tour guide. After few minutes he arrived, we rode a van going to the port and took us around 45mins to reach it. There&#8217;s a waiting area near the port and we waited there for them to finalise all the people who are coming. They offered snacks &amp; drinks while we wait. As soon as they are good to go they instructed us on where to go and from there, we walked.</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/5.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p>We rode a big boat going there. The view was outstanding! You can feel the sea breeze, it&#8217;s cool and refreshing! Just sitting in front of the boat staring at those beautiful islands as you get closer and closer to them makes this trip amazing! As you pass by them you get to cherish how beautiful God&#8217;s creations are. Thinking about nothing and you can really feel you are on a vacation and it&#8217;s very relaxing! This is how you enjoy these kinds of stuff!</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/34.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/6.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p>The water is nice and clear, we passed by small islands (which are made of limestones. Sadly, some of them went bad and were destroyed). We made a stop over here to do some activities I guess. Well, good thing I am using a rash guard because the sun is up!</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/8.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p>Our first activity was Canoeing and there will be someone who would row it, too bad we want to try rowing ourselves. Max of 4 per boat including the paddler. Anyway, more time for us to take videos and photos! We went through this bat cave to see natural limestones. The space on some areas are tight and you need to lower down your head so watch out for those ones! Our rower, who I forgot the name, was very entertaining. He shared some stories and talked about some culture and history of this place.</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/24.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/7.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/33.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/9.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p>This shot by our rower was pretty good! He knows a good angle and I bet he do this for everyone he has been rowing with for.<br />\nOkay so we roam around these islands maybe for 2 hours and we head back to the boat for lunch. Wooh the best time! We were already starving so it&#8217;s good time to eat.<br />\nWe were on the first batch to get back so we quickly get some food before everyone arrives and we might fall in line. It&#8217;s buffet so you can be full from this meal. They also provide free drinks like water &amp; softdrinks. They have beer but they are selling it though.</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/10.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p>They have rice, seafood, chicken, pork and noodles. I wasn&#8217;t expecting the food to be this good! I really love it especially the fish and the fried kale! It was very delish! It&#8217;s very oily though, but who cares? we&#8217;re on a vacation and might as well eat all the things we can!  The ambience is a plus. Eating good food with this kind of vibe and atmosphere is definitely a good experience!</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/25.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p>It was already around 2 in the afternoon by the time we finished lunch. The tour guide then told us we are going to do a small side trip to a small village  called Koh Panyee to see and experience how local people live here. Like what their homes look like and their culture.</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/26.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/38.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/40.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/39.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p>This is what their typical household looks like. Just small and simple. You can see a lot of kids running around the village, people working and building boats or sewing local clothes. They also have areas here where they sell local food and souvenirs. Oh, they also have a mosque here. This is a muslim community so they will have somewhere to pray on.</p>\n<h3>James Bond Island</h3>\n<p>After a short tour around. We went to our final destination and take a closer look at James Bond Island. This is where the hit film James Bond shoot before and that&#8217;s why this island is very famous aside from being awesome. If you have watched the Man with the Golden Gun, this places will look familiar for you. The place is interesting. You can roam around the area, buy souvenirs or refreshing snacks like cold coconut, shakes, ice cream etc. We only spent here around 30minutes if I remember it correctly since we are going somewhere to do snorkeling before the trip ends.</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/11.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/35.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p>We finished the tour around 4 in the afternoon. We were laughing because after we went to do snorkeling, we realized we didn&#8217;t brought any towel to wipe ourselves up. So we ended up being wet in the boat and the van going back to the port and our hostel. Travel time was around 45mins so we had a little rest but we were feeling cold because we did not get to dry up completely.</p>\n<p>On our way to the hostel, we passed by food stalls and a hawker centre, we thought of having dinner there since we saw a lot of tourists and even locals eating. So by the time we arrived at our hostel, we took a quick rest and had some beer in the lounge area because apparently one of our friend wants to take a nap first (weakling, haha)</p>\n<h3>Malin Plaza</h3>\n<p>Malin Plaza is 15mins walk away from the beach. But you could also ride a tuk-tuk. We prefer walking to enjoy the local experience and get to see some stalls on the way there.</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/27.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p>You get to choose from these fresh seafood, they have different kinds of fish, shrimp, prawns, squids, shells and even lobsters! Have them cook it and be back maybe within 15minutes or depends because some has a lot of orders and you might need to wait for longer time. But hey, it&#8217;s worth the wait! Anyway, you can roam around the area and check other food stalls while waiting. There are stalls selling noodles, chicken, duck, desserts like crepes and shakes. I recommend trying their fruit shake especially if the fruits are on season since it is very sweet and delish!</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/12.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/29.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p>So we end up ordering grilled pork ribs, fried duck and grilled stingray. Actually, this is our first time to try stingray. and for us, it is already an exotic food since we don&#8217;t get to see it being sold in the market where we came from. It was very good and interesting. We thought the texture will be some kind of rubbery based from its appearance, but hey the texture was similar to a fish. It&#8217;s very firm and tasty! We loved it! It&#8217;s a little bit bony though so watch out. The duck and grilled pork ribs was delish too! We had couple of beer to down this awesome food!</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/13.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<figure style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/28.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Grilled stingray</figcaption></figure>\n<p>After having dinner, we then roam around and went out for another night life, had some drinks, ate some food again(of course) and socialize with other people. We end up staying at the beach area again. It was more relaxing drinking there with your friends, sharing stories and get to meet some fellow travellers as well.</p>\n<p>At around 3 in the morning, we went back to the hostel and rest for the next day&#8217;s activities.</p>\n<h2>Day 3 &#8211; Phi Phi Island</h2>\n<p>We already booked the tour a day before because the receptionist told us this tour is always full since it&#8217;s the most popular one in Phuket. So, it has the same setup, someone will pick us up and will drop us off at the port. We did not had breakfast prior to this because the waiting area at the port will provide free snacks &amp; drinks.<br />\nAt the waiting area before getting on the boat, the tour guide briefed us on our itinerary for the day and asked us if we wanted to rent flippers to experience snorkeling better and because some areas of it has sea urchins underneath and might stung us.</p>\n<p>So, we are going to ride a big speed boat on this tour. You don&#8217;t get to see any view inside the speed boat unless you are in front where there is no shade and the sun is up and it&#8217;s really hot. We prefer to stay at the back instead. The boat was packed and all spaces are occupied.</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/14.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<h3>Maya Bay</h3>\n<p>So this is our first stop, Maya bay. The reason why we had to go here first is because the way going to Phi Phi Island has bad waves and passengers might get sea sick and start puking all over the boat which is not the thing you want to happen with this trip. A lot of tourists are here as well.</p>\n<p>We are going to spend approximately 2 hours here before going to Phi Phi Island. The tour guide will provide free fresh watermelons and pineapple! Yum! Apparently, you need to pay in order for you to use the beach chairs. We rented out two so we can put our things there.</p>\n<p>You get to do some snorkeling, roam around in this small island, take a lot of photos or just relax sitting in a beach chair eating fresh fruits together with a cocktail or a beer!</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/15.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<h3>Phi Phi Island</h3>\n<p>So after Maya Bay, we head to Phi Phi Island. It has two sides, and this is Phi Phi Leh. We spent 20 minutes here for picture taking or you can go swim in its clear waters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/16.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/37.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p>After Phi Phi Leh, we went to Phi Phi Don, its other side and had our lunch there. it&#8217;s a no pork buffet since the place is a muslim community and they don&#8217;t eat pork. It&#8217;s fine so we can get to eat healthy food like salads during this trip. Haha. The food was not that good though compared to our lunch yesterday. But the fruits are sweet!</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/31.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p>So it was already around 2pm by the time we finished eating lunch. We still had some minutes before we head back to the boat to do the last activity. We were so full and decided to lay down under the tree and just breathe fresh air. Watch out for some areas though since we saw a lot of dog poop so we made sure the place we are laying to is clean.</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/17.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p>For our last activity, we went snorkeling at the monkey beach and it&#8217;s just near the Phi Phi Island. There were monkeys in that beach(yes that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s called monkey beach). One funny thing happened apparently, a fellow traveler touched a young monkey and he was attacked by its parents then he ran out to the beach and swam. Haha. So never touch a monkey again!</p>\n<p>We snorkel for maybe 30minutes. I&#8217;m glad we rented out flippers because there were a lot of sea urchins underneath! I also saw nemo(clown fish). What a fantastic experience!</p>\n<p><img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/36.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" /></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s already past 4 in the afternoon by the time we finished the tour. We rested at the lounge area again and had couple of beers before going out to get dinner. We had dinner at Malin Plaza again and had fish &amp; noodles since we not that hungry. After dinner, we roam around bangla road and end up going to the beach to have some drinks. We met some fellow travellers from different parts of the world. We shared stories, had drinks and games. It was a fun and memorable night! Those memories are what you will cherish forever in these kinds of trips.</p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s already past 3 when we finished. We were very tired not having enough sleep and doing a lot of activities. Anyway, our agenda for our last day is just go to the city, buy some souvenirs and eat at a local hawker centre.</p>\n<h2>Day 4 &#8211; Phuket Town</h2>\n<p>So we woke up a bit late than usual. We head up to Phuket town, we actually got lost on our way because the receptionist didn&#8217;t understand us clearly and gave us wrong directions. Anyway, we just rode a cab going to town.</p>\n<p>The town was pretty quiet. We were supposed to go to a hawker centre to eat local food but it was closed and will be open at a later time. We then walked around and looked for food. We found a local food stall. The menu is written in Thai. Good thing there were pictures posted around and that&#8217;s how we ordered.</p>\n<p>Food was very good! I think this was the best meal we had during our stay. The drinks were also very good!</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/18.jpg\" alt=\"james bond phi phi island bangla road patong beach phuket thailand\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shrimp pad thai, noodle soup and fried pork</figcaption></figure>\n<p>After buying souvenirs, we went back to Patong beach and roam around for the last time before our flight back. 🙂</p>\n",

    "title": "The 3 Best Tonkotsu Ramen to try in Fukuoka, Japan &#8211; Yatai, Ippudo, Ramen Street",
    "excerpt": "Some people consider this if not the best, definitely one of the best ramen there is",
    "content": "<p><strong>Tonkotsu Ramen</strong> aka &#8220;<strong>Hakata Ramen</strong>&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p><i><b><span id=\"Tonkotsu\">Tonkotsu </span></b><span id=\"Tonkotsu\">(</span></i>&#8220;pork bone&#8221;) ramen usually has a cloudy white colored broth. It has a thick broth made from boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen over high heat for many hours, which suffuses the broth with a hearty pork flavor and a creamy consistency that rivals milk. The noodles are thin and straight, and it is often served with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Beni shoga\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beni_shoga\">beni shoga</a> (pickled ginger). In recent years the latest trend in <i>tonkotsu</i> toppings is <i>māyu</i> (<a title=\"Sesame oil\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_oil\">sesame oil</a>), a blackish, aromatic oil made from either charred crushed garlic or <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sesame seed\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_seed\">Sesame seeds</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fukuoka in Japan is the home of the BEST Tonkotsu Ramen.. Like me, people travel here from even from different parts of the world just to try this authentic ramen dish.</p>\n<p>You can find this ramen everywhere. Although all of them are good, we&#8217;re still going to have favorites! and these are my top 3 ramen places I recommend you must try when you visit Fukuoka, Japan.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Yatai (Food Stall in Fukuoka Streets) &#8211; Located in Nakasu River</strong></p>\n<p>There are a lot of Yatai spread out across Fukuoka city, but the famous are found around Tenjin and Nakasu. It was even rated one of the top street foods in Asia!</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Yatai are the outdoor food stalls that line Fukuoka’s streets, serving delicious food night after night before disappearing during the day time.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>People go here after work hours to have dinner or drinks with friends/colleagues.</p>\n<p>Each stall has specialty and they sell different kinds of food like bbq, sushi, shabu-shabu. But it is also a famous place for local Tonkotsu Ramen.</p>\n<p>Beside the stall you can check if they sell ramen or not, make sure to see the price first because some are really expensive and you might get shock when you&#8217;re about to pay the bill (like we did when we ordered BBQ)</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-792\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160414_203727_HDR-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"tonkotsu ramen fukuoka yatai ippudo\" width=\"1212\" height=\"683\" /> <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-796\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160414_210017_HDR-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"tonkotsu ramen fukuoka yatai ippudo\" width=\"1212\" height=\"683\" /></p>\n<p>All of them looks very good, just pick one based from your instincts. They are all delicious anyway.</p>\n<p>This guy is preparing our ramen. Yummmm!!</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-793\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160414_204251_HDR-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"tonkotsu ramen fukuoka yatai ippudo\" width=\"1212\" height=\"683\" /> <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-794\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160414_204436_HDR-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"tonkotsu ramen fukuoka yatai ippudo\" width=\"1218\" height=\"686\" /></p>\n<p>I added few pickled ginger and garlic to make it even more delicious!</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-795\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160414_204701_HDR-1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"tonkotsu ramen fukuoka yatai ippudo\" width=\"1216\" height=\"685\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>2. Ippudo &#8211; 10F AMU Plaza Hakata (Located in Hakata Station)</strong></p>\n<p>Ippudo is a very famous ramen chain and has several branches all over the world.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ippudo was first started in <a title=\"Fukuoka\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukuoka\">Fukuoka</a> by Shigemi Kawahara, the CEO of Chikaranomoto Company. &#8220;Ippudo&#8221; in direct translation means &#8220;one wind hall&#8221;, and this is named because at the time, there were dark clouds over the Kyushu ramen industry, and the founder CEO Kawahara intended to &#8220;blow wind and revolutionise the era&#8221;.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Based from a lot of people who tasted Ippudo aside from Hakata Branch, they said Hakata Ippudo is way better than what they had. And I agree with that for sure!</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-797\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160415_110108_HDR-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"tonkotsu ramen fukuoka yatai ippudo\" width=\"1220\" height=\"687\" />  <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-800\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160415_113220_HDR-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"tonkotsu ramen fukuoka yatai ippudo\" width=\"1218\" height=\"686\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-807 \" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160415_111055_HDR-e1466324910757-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"tonkotsu ramen fukuoka yatai ippudo\" width=\"1214\" height=\"684\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>3. Ikkousha Ramen &#8211; 2F Deitos Ramen Street (Located in Hakata Station)</strong></p>\n<p>Actually, this ramen chain is number 1 in Indonesia and Singapore and it even won in a ramen championship in Singapore. After eating this, it&#8217;s no wonder how it became very popular. The broth is very rich, milky in a balance way where you can just eat and eat. For all ramen lovers out there, I&#8217;m very sure you&#8217;ll love this ramen.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-806\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160421_160512_HDR-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"tonkotsu ramen fukuoka yatai ippudo\" width=\"1195\" height=\"673\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-803\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160421_160918_HDR-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"tonkotsu ramen fukuoka yatai ippudo\" width=\"1221\" height=\"688\" /></p>\n<p>Vending machine where you order your ramen from.<img class=\"wp-image-802 aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160421_160627_HDR-169x300.jpg\" alt=\"tonkotsu ramen fukuoka yatai ippudo\" width=\"740\" height=\"1314\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-805\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160421_162453_HDR-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"tonkotsu ramen fukuoka yatai ippudo\" width=\"1269\" height=\"715\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!--<strong>Other related blogs in Japan</strong>\nItineraries:\n<a href=\"https://whoisfelix.com/things-to-do-in-fukuoka-japan-nanzoin-temple-yatai-ippudo/\">Things to do in Fukuoka, Japan</a>\n<a href=\"https://whoisfelix.com/itinerary-in-osaka-dotonbori-osaka-castle-shinsekai/\">Things to do in Osaka, Japan\n</a><a href=\"https://whoisfelix.com/itinerary-in-tokyo-sensoji-temple-meiji-shrine-tsukiji-market-ueno-park-shinjuku-shibuya/\">Things to do in Tokyo, Japan</a>\n<a href=\"https://whoisfelix.com/itinerary-in-kyoto-golden-temple-bamboo-forest-fushimi-inari-shrine/\">Things to do in Kyoto, Japan</a>\n\nFood:\n<a href=\"https://whoisfelix.com/best-tonkotsu-ramen-fukuoka-japan-yatai-ippudo-ramen-street/\">Where to get ramen in Fukuoka, Japan</a>\n<a href=\"https://whoisfelix.com/osaka-dotonbori-non-stop-eating/\">Eat til you drop in Dotonbori, Osaka, Japan</a>\n\nAccommodation:\n<a href=\"https://whoisfelix.com/where-to-stay-in-japan-tokyo-osaka-kyoto-fukuoka/\">Where to stay in Fukuoka, Osaka &amp; Tokyo, Japan</a>--></p>\n",

    "content": "<h1>1D Itinerary in Fukuoka, Japan &#8211; Nanzoin Temple, Yatai, Ippudo</h1>\n<blockquote><p><b>Fukuoka</b> (<span class=\"t_nihongo_kanji\" lang=\"ja\">福岡市</span><i>Fukuoka-shi</i><sup class=\"t_nihongo_help noprint\"><a title=\"Help:Installing Japanese character sets\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets\"><span class=\"t_nihongo_icon\">?</span></a></sup>) is the capital <a title=\"Cities of Japan\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cities_of_Japan\">city</a> of <a title=\"Fukuoka Prefecture\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukuoka_Prefecture\">Fukuoka Prefecture</a> and is situated on the northern shore of the island of <a title=\"Kyushu\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyushu\">Kyushu</a> in Japan. As of July 2011, Fukuoka is Japan&#8217;s sixth largest city, having passed the population of <a title=\"Kyoto\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto\">Kyoto</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fukuoka was our first destination in Japan. The first reason why I like to visit Fukuoka was because of it&#8217;s authentic &amp; specialty  <a href=\"https://whoisfelix.com/index.php/2016/06/13/best-tonkotsu-ramen/\">Tonkotsu Ramen</a>. Some people consider this if not the best, definitely one of the best ramen there is. Although Fukuoka is not very popular destination in Japan comparing to Osaka, Kyoto or Tokyo. It still does offer good tourist destinations. This is the home of the biggest reclining Buddha in the world and where the famous Ramen Chain, Ippudo, originated from.</p>\n<p>Technically this itinerary is for 2 days but since we arrived at night time and will only spend half day the next day, it&#8217;s possible to count it just 1 day or less than 24hours. Yeah? 🙂</p>\n<h2>Arriving at Fukuoka, Japan</h2>\n<p>Okay. So we arrive late maybe around 9 in the evening.. getting to your hotel from the airport is easy. Just go to the exit and you will see a taxi stand. Give them the address and you will be on your way. It is metered and people here are honest so you don&#8217;t have to worry about anything.</p>\n<p>You can visit <a href=\"http://jprail.com/destinations/kyushu-area/how-to-access-from-fukuoka-airport-to-downtown-hakata-and-tenjin.html/comment-page-4\">this</a> or <a href=\"https://kyushu.com/fukuoka/survival/airport_to_city/\">this</a> for more details on how you can get to your destination coming off from the Fukuoka Airport.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-828\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160414_193428-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"nanzoin temple fukuoka japan\" width=\"1189\" height=\"670\" /></p>\n<h3>Accommodation &#8211; Hana Hostel</h3>\n<p>We booked an accommodation in Hana Hostel. Why Hostel? because it is relatively cheaper compared to hotels and we just need a place to stay and rest since we will get up early in the morning to go to Tokyo.</p>\n<p>The reviews of Hana Hostel are good and they&#8217;re located in the heart of Hakata. Actually, they are in a shopping street so restos/shops are just around your corner so it&#8217;s very accessible and convenient. You can check more of our stay with prices, etc. <a href=\"https://whoisfelix.com/where-to-stay-in-japan-tokyo-osaka-kyoto-fukuoka/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Checking in is fast and all went smooth. And don&#8217;t worry about the communication, they speak english.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-829\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160414_200348-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"nanzoin temple fukuoka japan\" width=\"1188\" height=\"669\" /></p>\n<p>Their room is clean and tidy and has everything we need for our stay like comfy beds, A/C, thick blankets, hot shower and fast wifi.</p>\n<p>*Photo was taken in the morning*</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-836 aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160415_075508.jpg\" alt=\"hana hostel\" width=\"819\" height=\"1456\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-837 aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160415_075524.jpg\" alt=\"hana hostel\" width=\"824\" height=\"1465\" /></p>\n<h3>Dinner &#8211; Fukuoka Yatai in Nakasu River</h3>\n<p><strong>Open</strong>: 6pm to around 2am &#8211; Daily</p>\n<p>Okay, after we checked in we went to a famous Yatai (Nakasu River) that is close in our accommodation (that&#8217;s why I chose Hana Hostel).</p>\n<p>We asked the lady in the reception of the Hostel for directions and we were on our way. I think it was around 10 &#8211; 15min walk going there from the Hostel. You will pass by shops and restos on your way to the river since you are at the heart of Hakata. Many people are still out even on late nights especially in this area.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not hard to find since it is just beside the river and you will see a lot of Yatai (Food Stall). If you notice that many people(especially tourist looking ones) are walking towards the same direction, you may assume they are going to a Yatai.</p>\n<p>I suggest to check all Yatai first so you will have a lot of options to choose from. All of them are good anyway but some are expensive than others. You might want to check the prices first so you won&#8217;t be shock when the bill comes.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-792\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160414_203727_HDR-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"yatai tonkotsu ramen\" width=\"1180\" height=\"665\" /></p>\n<p>You can check this <a href=\"https://whoisfelix.com/best-tonkotsu-ramen-fukuoka-japan-yatai-ippudo-ramen-street/\">blog</a> for our Yatai Experience and other ramen places in Fukuoka, Japan.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_839\" style=\"width: 1175px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-839\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160414_204526-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"yatai tonkotsu ramen\" width=\"1175\" height=\"662\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">our first ramen in Japan</figcaption></figure>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-838\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160414_203456_HDR-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"yatai tonkotsu ramen\" width=\"1187\" height=\"669\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-840\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160414_210420_HDR-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"yatai tonkotsu ramen\" width=\"1182\" height=\"666\" /></p>\n<h2>Following day..</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nanzoin Temple in Sasaguri, Fukuoka, Japan</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Lunch at Ippudo</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Train &#8211; Shinkansen to Tokyo</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Hakata Station</span> &#8211; Largest and busiest station in Kyushu Region of Japan.

It has a lot of advantage over Hotels like value for money, cleanliness, local flavor, social interaction etc. But the main reason was Hotel is more expensive in Japan and it will cost us triple the price. We just need a place to stay for the night since we&#8217;re leaving early in the morning and the location is very convenient since we are going to Nakasu River to have dinner in Yatai (walking distance from the Hostel). I make sure to read the reviews, feedbacks, the hostel&#8217;s facilities and their rules &amp; guidelines first before making a reservation.</p>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong>  1x night for 2 persons (currency convertion was made during the time we made the reservation)<br />\nPHP  2,800<br />\nor USD  59.5<br />\nor YEN  6,094</p>\n<p><strong>Check-in</strong> 3pm  &amp; <strong>Check-out</strong> 11am<br />\n<strong>Location</strong>: 4-213, Kamikawabata-machi, Hakata-ku, Fukuoka City, Japan<br />\n<strong>Getting there</strong>: We just took a taxi we payed around 2,500 Yen from Fukuoka Airport. The taxi dropped us off in the nearest street since they can&#8217;t go inside the shopping street. from there it only took us 2min walk going to the Hostel. You can also ride a train and just walk 10 minutes from the station.</p>\n<p>Where you can have a look for more details: <a href=\"http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Fukuoka-Hana-Hostel/Fukuoka-City/71709\">Hana Hostel</a></p>\n<p>Hana Hostel is located in the middle of a shopping street in CBD of Fukuoka so there is no problem getting dinner &amp; shopping because it&#8217;s already there at the front of your door!</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-830 aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160414_200405.jpg\" alt=\"hana hostel accommodation airbnb fukuoka osaka tokyo japan\" width=\"776\" height=\"1380\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-831\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160414_200423.jpg\" alt=\"hana hostel accommodation airbnb fukuoka osaka tokyo japan\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" /></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_836\" style=\"width: 695px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-836 \" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160415_075508.jpg\" alt=\"hana hostel accommodation airbnb fukuoka osaka tokyo japan\" width=\"695\" height=\"1236\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Double deck bed. very comfortable futon and thick blankets</figcaption></figure>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-837 aligncenter\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160415_075524.jpg\" alt=\"hana hostel accommodation airbnb fukuoka osaka tokyo japan\" width=\"682\" height=\"1212\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Tokyo</strong> &#8211; The capital &amp; busiest city of Japan.</p>\n<p>LINKS OF TOKYO ITINERARY</p>\n<p>We booked using <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com.au/\">AirBNB</a>.

They also have a lot of tourist destinations and adventure stuffs to offer. Taipei is the capital city of Taiwan and that is its most touristy place. One reason why I want to travel to Taiwan is because of their food. If only I can eat all what I can see and not be full. Food is cheap &amp; very good. A lot of night markets to shop. Friendly people. What&#8217;s not to love about taiwan?</p>\n<h2>Arrival in Taiwan</h2>\n<p>I arrived in Taiwan late at night around 9 and it was raining. You can either take a bus($125 NTD) or cab($1,000 NTD) going to your accommodation. I suggest to take a bus going to Taipei Main Station and from there take MRT or cab going to your accommodation so you can save money and just use that for food or shopping 🙂</p>\n<p>I stayed in a hotel. It was on a good location, few minutes walk to the night market &amp; train station and price is reasonable.</p>\n<p><strong>Fu Chang Hotel </strong><br />\n<strong>Address</strong>: 6, Kangding Rd, Ximending, Taipei, Taiwan 108<br />\n<strong>Price</strong>: 2x nights for 1 room (currency convertion was made during the time I made the reservation)<br />\nPHP 2,517.72 x 3 nights = 7,553.18 PHP<br />\nor USD 53.49 x 3 nights = 160.48 USD<br />\nor NTD  1,732.27 x 3 nights = 5,196.81 NTD</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1591\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/1-1.jpg\" alt=\"fu chang hotel taiwan\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1592\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1592 size-full\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/2-1.jpg\" alt=\"fu chang hotel taiwan\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bathroom was okay &amp; clean</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As soon as I put my things in the hotel I went outside to search for food. I was supposed to check a night market nearby but unfortunately the receptionist told me they are closed or didn&#8217;t bother to open up because it was raining hard that night. Anyway, I just roamed around the hotel and saw some food stalls.</p>\n<p>Good thing I passed by one and it looks good! You get your ingredients, put it in a plastic bag and they cook and put it in a bowl for you. I quickly get the things I want and asked them to cook it. I also asked them to add noodles. As per the picture, price is indicated and depends which ingredient you get.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1650\" style=\"width: 1280px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1650\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/13632835_1427516727265795_723874366_o.jpg\" alt=\"noodles soup taiwan\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">noodles soup taiwan</figcaption></figure>\n<p>First meal in taiwan.

I asked them and it was a Taiwan&#8217;s famous fried chicken street food. I bought a small bag and eat it while I was on my way back. After my first bite I had regrets that I should have bought a big bag instead. But anyway there&#8217;s still a lot of time for me to eat fried chicken. Haha.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1595\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/5-1.jpg\" alt=\"fried chicken food taiwan\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /></p>\n<p>There was nothing left to see around the hotel because it was already late.

Of course, I did not hesitate to buy one.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1651\" style=\"width: 1123px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\" wp-image-1651\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/13575461_1427516853932449_64426957_o.jpg\" alt=\"hotstar chicken taiwan\" width=\"1123\" height=\"842\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">hotstar chicken taiwan</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I think it was less than 10 degrees that time and was raining.

All of the stalls look good but I specifically searched for LAO WANG JI #15 Tao Yuan St. Good thing I have an idea on what the resto looks like and I assumed this was it when I saw a long line.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1610\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/20-1.jpg\" alt=\"beef noodle soup food taiwan\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /></p>\n<p>The beef noodle soup was very good! the beef was tender that melts in your mouth and the soup was amazing!

But the thing was I lined up for the bus going there. I was already waiting for 2 hours and I can&#8217;t see me getting to the bus for another 1-2hours. The travel time going there is around 45mins and it was already late. So I decided to skip that and go to the zoo and cable car instead. The cable car will not be open for the next day so I think its more appropriate to go there.</p>\n<p>I rushed myself going to the zoo but unfortunately it was already closed. Ooooh what a day! Good vibes, good vibes!</p>\n<h3>Maokong Gondola &#8211; Cable Car</h3>\n<p><strong>Access</strong>: <span class=\"CuHtmlEditColor993300\">MRT Wenshan-Neihu Line:</span> Get off at Taipei Zoo Station.

I can&#8217;t do anything about it so I just waited. Haha.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1623\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/33-1.jpg\" alt=\"maokong gandola taiwan\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /></p>\n<p>Riding that cable car was an awesome experience. After Maokong Gondola, I went to Taipei 101 as I assume the view is better at night.</p>\n<h3>Taipei 101</h3>\n<p><strong>Access</strong>: MRT &#8211; Take the Red Line <span title=\"\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-line=\"red\" data-placement=\"right\" data-original-title=\"Red - Xiangshan Line 2\">2</span> (Xiangshan train) to Taipei 101 station<br />\n<strong>Open</strong>: 9am &#8211; 10pm, last ticket sale 9.15pm<br />\n<strong>Price</strong>: adult/child NT$500/450</p>\n<p>There was a time before when this tower was the highest in the world.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1640\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/50.jpg\" alt=\"50\" width=\"1011\" height=\"1348\" /></p>\n<p>The observation deck of the tower.

I think they are photos of the owner with famous people. I assumed that this resto is famous so I decided to have dinner here.

It&#8217;s approximately 272 steps. That&#8217;s a lot of calories you will burn and an extra doughnut you can eat. Hehe. There are still things to see up there so it&#8217;s worth it.</p>\n<p>Awesome view from the top.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1668\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/IMG_20160206_112131_HDR.jpg\" alt=\"batu caves kuala lumpur malaysia\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" /></p>\n<p>You will see a lot of monkeys roaming around while climbing up the stairs.

Just get off at Sentral Station and from there take another train to the nearest stop going there.</p>\n<h3>Petronas Twin Towers</h3>\n<p><strong>Access</strong>: From KL Sentral, use the Rapid KLLRT Train (Kelana Jaya Line). Go to the Rapid KL LRT Platform to board the LRT train to the Gombak direction (not Kelana Jaya direction). The LRT will bring you directly to KLCC station and from there, just walk until you reach the towers.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an awesome feeling just standing here getting to see those towers. I always see it on magazines or news and it was a great experience to see it personally.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1674\" style=\"width: 1280px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1674 size-full\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/IMG_20160206_130319_HDR.jpg\" alt=\"petronas towers kuala lumpur malaysia\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">World&#8217;s tallest twin towers.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>You can also buy ticket and go up the tower and see the the beautiful city of Kuala Lumpur.

There&#8217;s a mall near the place where you can grab a quick bite. But if you still have energy, I suggest to try and eat at local areas to fully experience the place.</p>\n<p>It looks good from far view.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1675\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/IMG_20160206_135744_HDR.jpg\" alt=\"petrsonas towers kuala lumpur malaysia\" width=\"576\" height=\"1024\" /></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also malls near the place so you can do your shopping there if you still have time.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1676\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/IMG_20160206_141219_HDR.jpg\" alt=\"kuala lumpur malaysia\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" /></p>\n<p>I just walk around and might see anything I want. You can also go to Bukit Bintang, it&#8217;s near the towers. It&#8217;s a shopping area.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1677\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/IMG_20160206_141334_HDR.jpg\" alt=\"pavilion kuala lumpur malaysia\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" /></p>\n<h3>Bukit Bintang</h3>\n<p>If you are now hungry, I recommend to try Jalan Alor. It&#8217;s better if you go there at night time because that is the time where stalls are open. I&#8217;m not in KL at night time anymore so might as well go and check it out. It&#8217;s only a small walk from Bukit Bintang and you can see directions leading you there.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-1660 size-full\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/IMG_20160206_092029_HDR.jpg\" alt=\"bukit bintang malaysia\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" /></p>\n<p>As I expected, only few stalls are opened because it was still afternoon.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1678\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/IMG_20160206_143257_HDR.jpg\" alt=\"kuala lumpur malaysia\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" /></p>\n<h3>Jalan Alor in Bukit Bintang</h3>\n<p>The vibe is there.

How did I manage to do it?</h1>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1396\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1396 size-full\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160410_161327_HDR.jpg\" alt=\"mayon volcano legazpi philippines\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mt Mayon in Albay, Philippines</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A lot of people think that you need a lot of money to travel. Well, that is not totally true because it depends on how you manage your travel. Of course, most of us wants cheap rates and are on a budget. Some tips that I actually do are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>staying at hostels or b&amp;b</strong> &#8211; these accommodations are not bad just check the reviews &amp; feedbacks of past people who stayed there—and you get to meet fellow travellers there especially in hostels—chat with them, share stories and you can even ask for tips &amp; recommendations based from their experience</li>\n<li><strong>eat local food in hawker centres or in streets</strong> &#8211; this is actually a must since you basically want the good stuff and most of the time you can find and experience the best here</li>\n<li><strong>walk to your destination</strong> &#8211; walk it off! you will experience more and see how beautiful the city by taking it one step at a time rather than staying in a car!</li>\n<li><strong>less shopping</strong> &#8211; look for cheap bargains and buy only the things you need; but if you are there to shop well go for it!</li>\n</ul>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1350\" style=\"width: 960px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1350 size-full\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/YDXJ0342.jpg\" alt=\"felix in mekong delta vietnam\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mekong delta in Vietnam</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Set your priorities</h2>\n<p>Well technically yes, you need money to travel—but the truth is, it&#8217;s not all about money. It all depends on how you manage things and how you set your priorities. Some people see me travelling often, doing adventurous stuff and the first thing pops out of their mind is that I&#8217;m rich and have plenty of money—that is not true. We&#8217;re all the same who works very hard and earn money, we just have different ways of using it. For example, some people save up money for material things like new gadgets, clothes, shoes, etc and some save up for experiences like travelling and doing activities.</p>\n<p>Most of the time, people who are into material things tend to say that they don&#8217;t have money to travel because of this or because of that; the next thing you know is that they have brand new clothes, shoes and has the latest gadgets. Clearly, that is what they prioritize and save money for; maybe, that is what they want and makes them happy.</p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s my motivation?</h2>\n<p>This is how I invest my time and money. I&#8217;m still young and doesn&#8217;t have that much responsibilities yet. Spending my hard earned money in life experiences makes me feel satisfied. I&#8217;d like to reward myself from time to time by going to different places, trying new things, learn different cultures or meet new people on the road; because these are the things that makes me happy. At the moment, these are what motivates me, keeps me work hard and makes me look forward to something like what destination to go or activity to do next.</p>\n<p>I often spend money on material things and only when I really need one. I still use clothe<span class=\"text_exposed_show\">s even if I had it for years. I even rely having new things on the gifts I receive on my birthday or Christmas because that&#8217;s how thrifty I am! I don&#8217;t care not having the latest gadgets, new branded clothes, shoes or whatever; what I care at the moment is to see the world and experience life fully while I still can; because who knows? I might not be able to do these when I grow old. </span></p>\n<h2>Life experiences over material things</h2>\n<p>Instead of buying new stuff, I save my money for my next trip; mainly because this is what I want and makes me happy. I put effort in doing it and making sure it happens; because I believe that life experiences are more valuable than material things.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, there&#8217;s nothing wrong if you like to spend your money on material stuff. All of us have different sets of interest. This is just my opinion. Because at the end of the day, it&#8217;s your time and money; if those things makes you happy, sure why not—but I&#8217;ll tell you this, 5 or 10 years from now, your new clothes now will be old or was already thrown away; your new gadgets are obsolete—but for my life experiences? I&#8217;ll be able to cherish it forever.</p>\n<div class=\"text_exposed_show\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n",

Enjoying yourself as much as you can is what life is supposed to be while you&#8217;re young and able to do all stuff.

You make good or bad decisions and at the end of the day you are going to live with whatever you did. You just have to make sure that those are worth it. Happen to spent all of your money on a trip and did all the activities there is? Yup, you are broke at the moment, but it will past and you can get money afterwards, and for the experience? it&#8217;s still there and forever will be!</p>\n<p>When you grow up and start having a family of your own, your priorities in life will surely change. You think that you can still do these things when you grow old and already have a family but to be honest, you won&#8217;t. This means all your time and effort will need to focus with your family. Yourself comes at the very last. You need to provide for what they need and only when you can do what you like is when you have extra time and I&#8217;m pretty sure that will only come when you are already old and won&#8217;t be able to do so!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text_exposed_show\">\n<h2>Think about the present moment</h2>\n<p>You are still young and can handle pressure in life.

Looking back old photos, reminiscing good times with the people you&#8217;ve met on the road-sounds good right? or think of it like this, what are the things you&#8217;re going to share to your children or grandchildren? are you going to tell them a story how you collected signature shoes/bags or how you conquer your fear of heights by jumping off the highest bungee in the world? You know which is better and it&#8217;s not yet too late to do it. It&#8217;s just a matter of setting your priorities straight. If you persevere doing it, there&#8217;s always a way. But if not, there&#8217;s always an excuse. It&#8217;s all up to you if you&#8217;re going to make it happen or not. So, what are you waiting for?</p>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

    "content": "<h1>9 reasons why you should travel solo</h1>\n<p>Travelling solo might sound lonely but to be honest, it&#8217;s not. You will actually have a lot of advantage than travelling with someone. This will also help you conquer a lot of your fear, make you a better person, and be mature.</p>\n<h2>1. Gain confidence</h2>\n<p>Being alone on the road gives you a lot of time to discover more of yourself. I remember the first time I travelled alone where I had a lot of doubts and was hesitating to proceed with it even the trip was already booked. I had that fear inside me telling me a lot of what ifs, but I pushed myself and decided to just go for it and see what happens! After that solo trip and having experienced a lot of things, I never have been that happy and was very glad I did it! As a result, I learned a lot and became more confident of myself!</p>\n<h2>2. Be an adult and get out of your comfort zone</h2>\n<p>Maturity is one of the biggest factor when it comes to travelling solo and one way to go into that direction is to expose yourself in the outside world. To start with, you can do some exciting challenges and live differently everyday. This way you get to adapt to your surroundings bit by bit. You also don&#8217;t have to over think the decisions you make daily, just choose whatever you think is best. Don&#8217;t worry because you are still learning and no one will judge you.</p>\n<h2>3. The time is in your hands</h2>\n<p>Want to stay for a week in a hostel after months of travelling and just do nothing? or sleep the whole day and re-schedule your tour? You can! No one is going to ask you to wake you up early morning to get ready or go home because you have a scheduled tour the following day. You can do whatever you want!</p>\n<h2>4. Meet new people and gain friends</h2>\n<p>Often times, it&#8217;s hard to meet new people when you&#8217;re travelling in a group since you tend to stick together throughout the trip. It&#8217;s completely different when you are travelling alone because you will definitely need to socialise, and this gives you the opportunity to meet others and maybe be friends with them. While you are on the road, you will meet a lot of solo backpackers especially if you stay in hostels, which are the most popular accommodation for backpackers since they offer cheap accommodation and good discounted tours. You will meet a lot of fellow travellers who also faces the situation you are into–like travelling alone, trying to conquer their fears, and trying to get out of the comfort zone. Have a quick chat with them and share stories, and who knows, you might end up travelling together.</p>\n<h2>5. Go from introvert to extrovert</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re an introvert and doesn&#8217;t socialise with people because you&#8217;re shy, this might be a challenge for you initially but it will definitely help you to overcome that. Since you&#8217;re alone, you won&#8217;t be having any choice other than to mingle and socialise with strangers. If you always have doubts  or is hesitant to start a conversation with someone, my suggestion is–just do it! It will not hurt you making small talks–as a matter of fact, they will actually love if you&#8217;ll have a conversation with them. You can ask for advise or just tell your stories. Trust me, you&#8217;ll learn and experience a lot more and be glad you did it.</p>\n<h2>6. Planning your trip is easier</h2>\n<p>We all have reasons why we want to go in a particular place. Some of which are because of their local food, activities to do, fantastic scenic views, etc. Most of the time when we travel with someone, we often need to agree on a certain things like accommodation, restaurants, activities, or places to visit–then you will have someone who&#8217;s pain in the ass for being too picky and it might ruin the whole essence of travelling. However, when you&#8217;re alone, you can plan whatever you want to do or place to go without any hesitation.</p>\n<h2>7. Have an extensive understanding of the things around you</h2>\n<p>You only get a little possibility of noticing the tiny things happening around you when you&#8217;re with someone because you are distracted talking to them about random stuff. Being alone will give you the chance to observe a lot of tiny things happening around you and this will help you to learn more information about those.</p>\n<h2>8. No Drama</h2>\n<p>People&#8217;s attitude changes when travelling because they are in a whole lot different situation and place. This might shock you when they show you that side of their personality. For some instance, you may find them annoying because they are too picky on some things, doesn&#8217;t agree with you, or doesn&#8217;t have the same interests as yours–then end up arguing like small children subsequently having regrets travelling with them–this will definitely spoil the whole trip rather than enjoying it! On the other hand, you won&#8217;t need to deal with these things when you travel alone since you will have all the freedom to do whatever you want and no one will be in your way.</p>\n<h2>9. You will love yourself more</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Aside from that, subscribe to airlines so they can send you emails ahead of time before bringing out the promo deals so you get to have advantage over others.</p>\n<p>These websites can help you compare cheap deals from different airlines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.skyscanner.com.au/\">https://www.skyscanner.com.au/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.flightcentre.com.au/\">http://www.flightcentre.com.au/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>TIP: Most of the time, airlines give out airfare promos and seat sale starting at midnight, and a lot of people are already waiting and checking by this time so you need to be quick on booking one. Try your luck&#8230;</p>\n<h2><strong>Accommodation</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stay in Hostels</strong> &#8211; staying at hostels is not bad as you think. check first feedbacks and reviews before booking it. There are a lot of perks in a hostel like:\n<ul>\n<li>price is relatively much cheaper than hotels</li>\n<li>better location since most are in around CBD areas</li>\n<li>provides best deals (eg: discounts) on local tours and activities</li>\n<li>social gatherings like pubcrawl to experience local nightlife</li>\n<li>lounge area to meet fellow travellers and have a chit-chat</li>\n<li>free coffee/tea through out the day</li>\n<li>free unlimited wi-fi</li>\n<li>use of laundry &amp; dyer</li>\n<li>some provide cheap BBQ events</li>\n<li>very helpful staffs &#8211; they know what travellers needs and wants, so they provide guides and tips as well</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-830\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160414_200405.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20160414_200405\" width=\"576\" height=\"1024\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stay in apartments such as AirB&amp;B</strong> &#8211; AirB&amp;B is something where owners let their flat/house be rented out for travellers for probably extra cash (you can do it as well). For me, it&#8217;s a lot better than hotels, because it&#8217;s relatively cheaper, and it has other add-ons like kitchenette, washing machine, and some even provide pocket wifi(which is a very big plus!). So if you want to feel like you&#8217;re a local, this type of accommodation suits you best! and for some instance, you might be staying with the owner, while for some, they just give you instructions to follow on how to get to the apartment. As long as you keep the place clean, there will be no problem.<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-878\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160417_165823_HDR.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20160417_165823_HDR\" width=\"1279\" height=\"720\" /></li>\n<li><strong>Couchsurfing</strong> &#8211; local people are willing to host their place and provide accommodation for travellers for free. A lot of people do this to save money on accommodation. You can do a background check and see feedback/reviews of the host first to make sure you&#8217;re going to be on a safe place. Thinking what is it for them on why they do this? Well, they have a chance to meet travellers, exchange stories, or know more about each other cultures, and for you, it&#8217;s free accommodation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Food &#8211; best way is to eat local food</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Street food </strong>&#8211; Places like Taiwan, Japan, or any other Asian Countries has a lot of street foods anywhere you go. These places are my favourite to go to since they&#8217;re cheap and great! you&#8217;ll also have that amazing local vibe experience. You get to taste what local food really is. As long as you see how they prepare the food and it&#8217;s clean you&#8217;re good to eat.<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1650\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/13632835_1427516727265795_723874366_o.jpg\" alt=\"noodles soup taiwan\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" /></li>\n<li><strong>hawker centres</strong> &#8211; it&#8217;s similar to a food court. All stuff they sell are local food that are cheap &amp; affordable, and it&#8217;s very good!<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1537\" src=\"https://felixstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/29.jpg\" alt=\"29\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /></li>\n<li><strong>make / cook your own</strong> &#8211; using local ingredients is good and you have the options on what you like to put in your food (if you like to be healthy)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Check for discounts</strong></h2>\n<p>So when you are doing your itineraries, you might want to check out some websites that provide cheap deals and discounts for activities, accommodation, or food. eg:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.scoopon.com.au\">https://www.scoopon.com.au</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.groupon.com.au\">https://www.groupon.com.au</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Apart from these, you can also find some when you ask for local maps, local news papers, or ads/flyers being given in the streets. Don&#8217;t be embarrassed of using one, because remember, every dollar counts. Whatever it is, if you can save money from it, it&#8217;s a good thing!</p>\n<h2><strong>Research, read, and learn on blog sites</strong></h2>\n<p>Read a lot of blog sites and get ideas from them on what they normally do on travelling. These guys already has a lot of experience and will share their tips and tricks so readers can also have the same or better experiences. Some websites like <a href=\"https://www.traveloka.com/en-ph\" target=\"_blank\">Traveloka</a> would help you on these, spare some extra time to explore the website for it may help you later on.</p>\n<h2><strong>Join free walking tours</strong></h2>\n<p>Just search on free walking tours held in the place you&#8217;re at or going to. They have ads on social media like facebook, instagram, twitter, etc,. Often times, they do this in CBD area. It&#8217;s a good experience as they talk about history, culture, etc,. You can also ask them about guides &amp; tips on things you can do or places to eat as they know most of the stuff happening in that area.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n",
